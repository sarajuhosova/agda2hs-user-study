# Agda2HS User Study

This repository contains the project that will be used for the Agda2HS user study.

The project has the following structure:

* `app`: the directory containing the executable Haskell app. It runs the QuickCheck test.
* `lib`: The directory which contains the Agda solution files.
* `lib/Help`: A directory containing helper methods for the exercises.
* `src`: A git-ignored directory into which Agda2HS generates the Haskell code. 
* `default`: A helper directory for this particular project setup which contains parital Haskell implementations of all the exercises. They are used to make the Haskell code while the exercise hasn't been implemented yet. The are **not** meant to serve as inspiration.

*The only directory you are supposed to edit is `lib` (excluding `lib/Help`).*

### How to Use this Project

To create a solution for the exercise, do the following:

1. Create a file in the `lib` directory with the indicated filename.
2. Add the following into your newly created file:

```agda
module <module_name> where

open import Haskell.Prelude
```

3. Type-check the file using `Ctrl + c, Ctrl + l`.
4. Start implementing.
5. To run the exercise, run `make A=<exercise_tag>`.

## Example: Reverse

File name: `Reverse.agda`
Module name: `Reverse`
Exercise tag: `reverse`

**Task:** Implement a `reverse` function, which takes a list and reverses it.

*Examples:*
* `reverse [1, 2, 4] == [4, 2, 1]`
* `reverse [] == []`
* `reverse ['d', 'g', '5', 'x'] == ['x', '5', 'g', 'd']`

Include the following guarantees in your Agda code:

1. Reversing an empty list yields an empty list (`reverse [] == []`).
2. Reversing a list with a single element yields the same list (`reverse [x] == [x]`).
3. Reversing a reversed list yields the original list, i.e. reverse is the inverse of itself (`reverse (reverse xs) == xs`).
4. Reversing two appended lists is the same as appending the second list reversed to the first list reversed (`reverse (xs ++ ys) â‰¡ reverse ys ++ reverse xs`).

To run the tests for this assignment, run `make A=reverse`.

## Exercise 1: The `All` Type

File name: `All.agda`
Module name: `All`
Exercise tag: `all`

**Task:** Implement the [Haskell `All` type](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.18.0.0/docs/Data-Monoid.html#t:All) - the boolean monoid under conjunction.

1. Define the `All` type.
2. Create an instance for `Eq`, `Ord`, `Show`, and `Bounded`. These should all be available on the Agda side.
3. Create an instance for `Semigroup` that is available on the Agda side.
4. Prove that the `Semigroup` instance is lawful (you can see which laws should hold in the [Haskell documentation](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.18.0.0/docs/Data-Semigroup.html)).
5. Create an instance for `Monoid` that is available on the Agda side.
6. (Optional) Create an instance for `Read`. This instance does not need to be available on the Agda side.
7. (Optional) Create an instance for `Generic`. This instance does not need to be available on the Agda side.

To run the tests for this assignment, run `make A=all`.

## Exercise 2: Safe `lookup`

File name: `Lookup.agda`
Module name: `Lookup`
Exercise tag: `lookup`

**Task:** Implement a `lookupSafe` function, which looks up a value in a list of key-value pairs.
The compiled Haskell signature of this method should be `lookupSafe :: Eq a => a -> [(a, b)] -> b`.

*Examples:*
* `lookupSafe 2 [(1, "H"), (2, "e"), (3, "l"), (4, "l"), (5, "o")] == "e"`
* `lookupSafe 'r' [('W', True), ('o', False), ('r', False), ('l', False), ('d', False)] == False`

Include the following guarantees in your Agda code:

1. A `lookupSafe` can only happen if the list contains the key.

Use the `contains` and `containsTail` definitions in the `Help.Contains` module.

To run the tests for this assignment, run `make A=lookup`.
